        Teamwork is working together of people to achieve a certain goal.
        Teamwork is the basic need for an organization to function. Furthermore,
        every organization has a division of several teams to perform specific
        tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without teamwork nothing is possible. Moreover, if any organization
        lacks teamwork. Then it will hamper its success rate. Thus the
        organization will fall. Also, it will affect the environment the people
        are working in.
      </p>

        This team of workers focuses on the implementation of the policies made
        by the Top-level. Furthermore, the team assigns various tasks to the
        employee sector, so that they may work towards the goals of the company.
        Moreover, the Middle level inspects and keeps a regular check on their
        work. In short, they bridge the gap between the top level and the middle
        level. In order to be a part of this team, a person should be qualified
        enough. Because this ensures that the person is having the knowledge of
        all the work he is assigning to the employees. Only then the person
        would be capable enough to guide the lower level. Above all the main
        work is to meet the demands of the employee, so that the organization
        can work in a better way.
