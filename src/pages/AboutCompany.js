        Although the company blurb needs to inform readers about what the
        company does, it needs to do this in a very focused way. Most companies
        offer many different types of products or services. The blurb is not the
        place to describe them all. Instead of listing the variety of things
        your company does, focus on the key items as an overview. For example, a
        local vegetable distributor might define the company focus like this:
        "Getting organic, locally grown vegetables to restaurants within 24
        hours of harvest."
      </p>

        As good as a story is at hitting the reasons why the company is great,
        consumers need to know: "What's in it for me?" The blurb should focus on
        one or two key benefits. Let consumers know what they get when they do
        business with the company. Examples of benefits might be convenience,
        superior products, award-winning services or customization for the
        customer's needs. For example, a promotional product provider might
        express the benefit like this: "Be remembered in a way as unique as your
        company."

        The blurb isn't a scholarly excerpt. A company paragraph that tells a
        story will engage the reader. Good storytelling builds positive brand
        awareness and makes the company memorable to consumers. Ideally, readers
        then begin to look at other information about products and services. For
        example, an organic coffee brand might talk about the origins of the
        beans, "Sustainable farming methods in the fertile high-altitude regions
        of Chile...." The messaging goal aims to hit the emotional triggers such
        as earth consciousness and global warming.
